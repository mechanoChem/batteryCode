Overview
====================================================================

batteryCode is based on deal.ii (www.dealii.org). It consists of four four modules. 1. battey_base provide generic finite element code; 2. model consists of mechanics at finite strain, reaction-diffusion equations and Possion equations; 3. ElectricChemoExpression provides electric-chemical formulations e.g. Butler-Volmer equations. 4. Application consists of specific application.

To run one application please switch to the correspding branch. Then goes to application/

Currently we have:

1.homogenzed model 
 Note: original_code is old code for paper Z. Wang, J. Siegel, K. Garikipati, ‚ÄúIntercalation driven porosity effects on the electro-chemo-thermo-mechanical response in continuum models for battery material electrodes‚Äù. 
2.particle model (coming soon)
